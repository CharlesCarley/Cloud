    A green connection icon <span class="icon-connected green-fg-5"></span>
    indicates that there is a present connection to the backend database.
    A red icon indicates that there is no connection. Connection parameters are set on startup. 
    If the icon is red, check the appsettings.json file for the following:
<pre class="m-0 code-fragment"><code>"DataBaseHostConfig": {
    "Host": "A full path to the database service.",
    "Port": "The port that the service is listening on."
}
</code></pre>
    <p>
        The current application is trying to connect to: 
        <code >@Transaction.Host:@Transaction.Port</code>. If 
        that is correct, try pinging the service with curl.
    </p>
    <pre class="m-0 code-fragment" ><code>curl -v http://[path-to-service]:[port]/ping</code></pre>
    <p>After a successful connection, the output from the ping route should be:<pre class="m-0 code-fragment">Cloud.Store running successfully</pre></p>
